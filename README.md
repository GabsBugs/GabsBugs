  <summary><b> My world! </b></summary>

  <br />
  <p>My name is Gabrielly, but people usually call me Gabs or Gabi, I'm 19 years old and I'm from Brazil. <img height="15px" width="20" src="https://emojigraph.org/media/facebook/flag-brazil_1f1e7-1f1f7.png"/> </p>
  <p> This is a tab that has random things about things I like, for those who want to know me better :) </p>
  <p> I speak Portuguese, but my github is all in English (you probably already noticed that haha) because, I'm taking the opportunity to practice my English. So, sorry for the mistakes, and if you want to give me any tips or feedback, you can email me! </p>
  <p> If you want to talk, debate or ask me about a topic I wrote here, you can send me an email too <3 </p>

       <summary><b>“How to love life” according to Nietzsche  </b>
       </summary>
     <br />
       <p> 

"Amor Fati. <br>
Amor Fati is the Latin phrase for “Love Of Fate”. Greatness does not come from trying to escape or avoid the hard parts of life; it comes from embracing them. <br>
Amor Fati would then be the supreme act of self-love, you look at your life and recognize that to be who you are today everything had to happen the way it did! Yes, some things were tremendously unfair! others leave you awake at night thinking “what if it was different…”, but, in the end each of these pains taught you something, for that reason they deserve your love, not because they were good, but, because they are part of you! Maybe you are not even happy with who you are today, but, there you are! thanks to what happened to you, now you know what needs to change and you also know that it won't be easy..."</p>

       <summary><b>“God” according to Baruch Spinoza  </b>
       </summary>
     <br />
       <p> I am agnostic, but Spinoza's God touches me a lot, Spinoza's God is Nature, Love...

MESSAGE FROM GOD, ACCORDING TO BARUCH SPINOZA <br>
“Stop praying and beating your chest! What I want you to do is go out into the world and enjoy life. I want you to enjoy, sing, have fun and enjoy everything I've done for you.
Stop going to those gloomy, dark, cold temples that you built yourself and believe to be my home! My home is the mountains, the forests, the rivers, the lakes, the beaches, where I live and express Love for you.
Stop blaming me for your miserable life! I never said that there is something bad about you, that you are a sinner or that your sexuality is a bad thing. Sex is a gift I gave you and with which you can express love, ecstasy, joy. So don't blame me for everything you've been led to believe.
Stop reading supposed holy scriptures that have nothing to do with me! If you can't read me in a sunrise, in a landscape, in the eyes of your friends, in the eyes of your little boy, you won't find me in any book.
Trust me and stop asking me! Will you tell me how to do my job?
Stop being afraid of me! I don't judge him, or criticize him, or get angry, or bother him, or punish him. I am pure Love.
Stop asking me for forgiveness! There is nothing to forgive. If I did, I filled it with passions, limitations, pleasures, feelings, needs, inconsistencies, free will. How can I blame you if you respond to something I put in you? How can I punish him for being the way he is if I did?
Do you think I could create a place to burn all my misbehaving children for the rest of eternity? What God would do that? Forget any kind of commandment, any kind of law, which are tricks to manipulate you, to control you, which only create guilt in you!
Respect your neighbor and don't do to the other what you don't want for yourself! Pay attention to your life, let your alertness be your guide!
This life is not a test, not a stepping stone, not a step along the way, not a rehearsal, not a prelude to paradise. This life is all there is to it here and now, and all you need.
I made it absolutely free. There are no prizes or punishments. There is not neither sins nor virtue. Nobody takes a score. Nobody takes a record. You are absolutely free to make your life heaven or hell.
I couldn't tell you if there is something after this life, but I can give you some advice: Live as if there wasn't, as if this was your only opportunity to enjoy, to love, to exist. So, if there is nothing, you will have enjoyed the opportunity I gave you.
And if there is, rest assured that I won't ask if you've behaved or not. I'll ask if you liked it, if you had fun, what you liked the most, what you learned.
Stop believing me! To believe is to suppose, guess, imagine. I don't want you to believe me, I want you to feel me in you. I want you to feel me in you when you kiss your loved one, when you wrap your little girl, when you caress your dog, when you bathe in the sea.
Stop praising me! What kind of egotistical God do you believe I am? It annoys me to be praised. I'm tired of being thanked. Do you feel grateful? Show it by taking care of yourself, your health, your relationships, the world. Do you feel looked at, surprised? Express your joy! That's one way to praise me.
Stop complicating things and repeating like a parrot what you were taught about me! The only certainty is that you are here, that you are alive and that this world is full of wonders.
What do you need more miracles for? Why so many explanations? Don't look for me outside. You won't find me. Look for me inside you. That's where I am, hitting you.”</p>
